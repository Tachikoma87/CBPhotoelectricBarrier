This is the repository for the paper "A Novel Inexpensive Camera-based Photoelectric Barrier System for Accurate Flying Sprint Time Measurement". It shows how the build cost-effective photoelectric barriers based on consumer grade electronic components with an accuracy on par with professional time measurement systems. The repository contains building plans for the devices, software for the microcontroller, and the Android app required for controlling the system and display the time measurements.
