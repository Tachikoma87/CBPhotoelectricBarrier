/**
 * This example shows how to measure the voltage and remaining relative charge of a common NiMh rechargeable battery.
 * To test connect the anode (+) of the battery to an analog pin and the cathode (-) to ground. 
 * You can also test several batteries in series, but only up to 3 for an Arduino since 4 batteries can exceed the 5V limit and
 * may fry your board (or just trigger a fuse if you are lucky).
 * To get exact measurements you have to determine the voltage your board provides. Use a multimeter and measure voltage between 5V (or 3.3V) pin and ground.
